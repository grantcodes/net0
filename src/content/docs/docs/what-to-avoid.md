title: What to avoid
---

There are certain things to try and avoid while building any digital product.

## Solutions in search of a problem

Be concious of what you are making. It does have an impact in the world.

## Crypto

Crypto requires a huge amount of energy, with relatively little proven use cases that cannot be achieved with more sustainable technology.

## AI

AI can require a large amount of energy to train and run, and poses many ethical issues. It can be a very powerful tool, but should be used responsibly in order to improve the planet.

## 3rd party scripts

It's very common practice to embed 3rd party scripts into websites, but they can severly affect performance, privacy and energy usage.

As with most other things, be concious of their impact and avoid them when possible.
