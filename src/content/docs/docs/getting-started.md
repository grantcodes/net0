description: How to get up and running with Net0.1 to build a sustainable website.
---

To get started, create an Astro site making use of this template:

```bash
npm create astro@latest --template grantcodes/net0
```

The Astro command line tool should automatically run you through setting up some important information for your website and install everything required.

To work on your site locally, run the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start a development server and allow you to open your site in a browser. As you make changes to your files, the server will automatically reload to show your updates.

Once you're happy with how your site looks, you can build it for production using:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate a optimized version of your site ready for deployment. You can find the built files in the `dist` directory.
