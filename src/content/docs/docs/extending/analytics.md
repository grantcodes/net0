title: Adding analytics
---

Analytics are a ubiquitous part of the current web. They can be very useful for businesses to measure and improve their products, but unfortunately they can be a ecological and ethical disaster making websites much larger and invading the privacy of visitors.

Analytics should only be used if there is a clear requirement for them, and some options are better than others.

If you are able to self host analytics which do not leak data to third parties, that would be ideal, but either way you can make a conscious decision to choose a more sustainable option.
